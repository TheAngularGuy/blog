        Hello, I am Mustapha AOUAS → JavaScript / Typescript developer.
        <br>
        For me each day begins with a cup of coffee and the newest programming posts.
        In turn, I like to contribute to the community by sharing my knowledge through talks,
        workshops and articles.

        <br>

        Learning the web is not a destination, it's a direction. Embark with me in this journey!
